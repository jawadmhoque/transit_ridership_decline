High priority clean up

1. Plot TOT_EMP_MSA instead of Tot_Emp_TSD.  

2. Plot AVG_SPEED instead of Tot_Pop_TSD. 

3. Check places where Population/Census data stops/goes to zero.  Pascagoula, MS for example. 

4. Add title to charts. 

5. Why is Chicago-Joliet-Naperville missing Census data for most years? 

6. .fillna(0) for dockCt, docklessCt, scooterCt.  

7. TNC flag is missing in Chicago.  Why is this? Others missing or strange:

    - Check biggest cites
    - Interpolate smaller cities based on what we did today. 
    
8. Income percentages always go to zero in 2018. 

9. Total population goes to zero in 2018.  Check or extrapolate. 

10. Check Springfield IL.  


Lower priority clean-up

1. Drop temporary and unused field.  UPT_ADJ, etc. Total_Pop_Poverty

2. Standardize names:  SHARE or PCT

3. Check zero data in poverty measures
